# Trunk-Player-NG

This is the front-end repository for Trunk-Player-NG. This project is still in development.

## About Project Branches

The default branch is `develop` and that is the current, unreleased version of the Trunk-Player-NG frontend. At this time, the project is unreleased (even pre-alpha), so this is the only branch worth checking out unless you are developing on this project.

### `feature/*` Branches

If you are developing for the Trunk-Player-NG project, please create an issue for the feature you are working on and perform commits in that branch only. If you are a project owner, you can do it on the Trunk-Player/Trunk-PlayerNG-Frontend repository or from a fork and submit a pull request for either method. If you are an outside contributor, you must use a fork and submit a pull request.
